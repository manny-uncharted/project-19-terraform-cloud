## Introduction
By now you should have a basic understanding of Terraform and how it works. If not, please read the [Terraform Getting Started Guide](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) first. And be very comfortable with writing HCL code. We would move forward with migrating our infrastructure to Terraform Cloud and also configuring the deployment to work using Ansible, and Packer for building the images.


## Prerequisites
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) is installed on your local machine.
- [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/signup/account) account.
- [Previous project code](https://github.com/manny-uncharted/terraform-codes-project-18)


## Terraform Cloud
Terraform Cloud is a managed service that provides you with Terraform CLI to provision infrastructure, either on demand or in response to various events.

By default, Terraform CLI performs operations on the server when it is invoked, it is perfectly fine if you have a dedicated role that can launch it, but if you have a team who works with Terraform â€“ you need a consistent remote environment with remote workflow and shared state to run Terraform commands.

Terraform Cloud executes Terraform commands on disposable virtual machines, this remote execution is also called remote operations.

### Migrate your Terraform code to Terraform Cloud
Let's go through the process of migrating our codes to Terraform Cloud and managing our infrastructure from there.

1. Create a Terraform Cloud account and log in to the dashboard.

2. Create an organization ensure you choose version control as your VCS provider and select GitHub, also select the repository you want to use, the repository should contain your Terraform code and not be empty.

3. Create a workspace, you can create a workspace for each environment you have, for example, you can create a workspace for your development environment, staging environment, and production environment.

4. Configure your variables, you can configure your variables in the workspace settings, you can also configure your variables in the Terraform code, but it is recommended to configure your variables in the workspace settings. Set two environment variables, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, these variables will be used to authenticate Terraform to AWS.

result:

5. Now it's time to run our Terraform code, but before we do that we need to do the following:
    - Packer to build the AMI
    - Ansible to configure the infrastructure

    Ensure you have Packer and Ansible installed on your local machine, and also ensure you have your AWS credentials configured in your local machine.

    - Packer -[Installation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/tutorials/docker-get-started/get-started-install-cli)
    - Ansible -[Installation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#pip-install)


## Building images using Packer
Packer is a tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating system, and is highly performant, creating machine images for multiple platforms in parallel.

- Create a directory called `ami` in your project folder. This directory will contain the packer configuration files for our ami's.

- Create a file called `bastion.pkr.hcl` in the `ami` directory, this file will contain the configuration for our bastion host.
```hcl
variable "region" {
  type    = string
  default = "us-east-1"
}

locals {
  timestamp = regex_replace(timestamp(), "[- TZ:]", "")
}


# source blocks are generated from your builders; a source can be referenced in
# build blocks. A build block runs provisioners and post-processors on a
# source.
source "amazon-ebs" "terraform-bastion-prj-19" {
  ami_name      = "terraform-bastion-prj-19-${local.timestamp}"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  region        = var.region
  source_ami_filter {
    filters = {
      name                = "RHEL-8.2_HVM-20200803-x86_64-0-Hourly2-GP2"
      root-device-type    = "ebs"
      virtualization-type = "hvm"
    }
    most_recent = true
    owners      = ["309956199498"]
  }
  ssh_username = "ec2-user"
  tag {
    key   = "Name"
    value = "terraform-bastion-prj-19"
  }
}

# a build block invokes sources and runs provisioning steps on them.
build {
  sources = ["source.amazon-ebs.terraform-bastion-prj-19"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    script = "bastion.sh"
  }
}
```

- Create a file called `bastion.sh` in the `ami` directory, this file will contain the repositories we need to install on our bastion host.
```bash
# user data for bastion

#!/bin/bash
